That's a good question [original poster]. Here's a list to answer it.

I'm going to leave links to credible news sources for each item. Each link is just gonna be right below the claim, so if you wanna check it out for yourself go right ahead. I'd really encourage going through these links anyways.

These next few items are concrete reasons for being removed from office.

1. Withholding $400M in foreign aid to Ukraine in order to blackmail the Ukrainian president into launching an investigation into Trump's main political opponent, Joe Biden, for reasons that were already thoroughly debunked and known to be debunked by Trump at the time.

1.a. It is illegal to ask for foreign aid in an election. In an incredibly bold act of stupidity, Trump asked China to investigate the Bidens while on live television. The difference between this and Ukraine is that we are not withholding $400M in military aid to China just because they aren't launching an illegitimate into Trump's political rival.

1.b. Here is a source for the legality of asking for foreign aid in an election, in case you were wondering:

52 U.S. Code § 30121 - Contributions and donations by foreign nationals

2. Asking Comey to end the Flynn investigation. This investigation was attempting to ascertain whether there was a link between Russia and Trump's own 2016 campaign. This is abuse of his executive powers and obstruction of justice.

3. Firing Comey when he didn't end the investigation involving Trump's own campaign. Another obstruction of justice and abuse of executive powers.

4. Attempting to fire Mueller, the man who replaced Comey as the head of the investigation. Another obstruction of justice.

6. Accepting foreign help during the 2016 campaign from Russia, as discovered by the Mueller investigation.

"If we had had confidence that the president clearly didn't commit a crime, we would have said so." - Robert Mueller

"Under longstanding department policy, a president cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office." - Robert Mueller

8.b. Trump's "Grab them by the pussy" comment (which has its own list item farther down at #16) seems to reinforce the evidence that he has a thing for sexual battery.

9. Tweeting a picture of at-the-time classified photographs taken from our satellites.

11. Running a fraudulent charity, and being banned from ever running another charity in New York. One example of his charity fraud was redirecting over $264,231 from the Foundation to fix a fountain in one of one of his hotels.

Here are some reasons for why he's not such a great president in general. These don't necessarily mean these are reasons to be removed from office, just that he's not the best president in the world.

12. Trumps own opinion: 
When asked what he thought of Hillary Clinton winning the election, he said that being a president while being under criminal investigation would make it 'impossible for her to govern'. Trump has been under investigation for most of his presidency, and it seems he was right about not being able to govern while under investigation.

15. Signs of dementia:

15.a. The nuclear rant (a timeless classic in my opinion):
“Look, having nuclear — my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer, Dr. John Trump at MIT; good genes, very good genes, OK, very smart, the Wharton School of Finance, very good, very smart — you know, if you’re a conservative Republican, if I were a liberal, if, like, OK, if I ran as a liberal Democrat, they would say I’m one of the smartest people anywhere in the world — it’s true! — but when you’re a conservative Republican they try — oh, do they do a number — that’s why I always start off: Went to Wharton, was a good student, went there, went there, did this, built a fortune — you know I have to give my like credentials all the time, because we’re a little disadvantaged — but you look at the nuclear deal, the thing that really bothers me — it would have been so easy, and it’s not as important as these lives are (nuclear is powerful; my uncle explained that to me many, many years ago, the power and that was 35 years ago; he would explain the power of what’s going to happen and he was right — who would have thought?), but when you look at what’s going on with the four prisoners — now it used to be three, now it’s four — but when it was three and even now, I would have said it’s all in the messenger; fellas, and it is fellas because, you know, they don’t, they haven’t figured that the women are smarter right now than the men, so, you know, it’s gonna take them about another 150 years — but the Persians are great negotiators, the Iranians are great negotiators, so, and they, they just killed, they just killed us.”

15.b. The windmill rant (my current favorite):
"We’ll have an economy based on wind. I never understood wind. You know, I know windmills very much. I’ve studied it better than anybody. I know it’s very expensive. They’re made in China and Germany mostly — very few made here, almost none. But they’re manufactured tremendous — if you’re into this — tremendous fumes. Gases are spewing into the atmosphere. You know we have a world, right? So the world is tiny compared to the universe. So tremendous, tremendous amount of fumes and everything. You talk about the carbon footprint — fumes are spewing into the air. Right? Spewing. Whether it’s in China, Germany, it’s going into the air. It’s our air, their air, everything — right? So they make these things and then they put them up."

...Which includes wonderful zingers like:

"I never understood wind. You know, I know windmills very much. I’ve studied it better than anybody."

"You know we have a world, right? So the world is tiny compared to the universe."

16. The "Grab em by the pussy" quote:
"I'm automatically attracted to beautiful [women]—I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star they let you do it. You can do anything ... Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything."

17. "I like people who weren't captured", when talking about American prisoners of war. Pretty rich coming from the guy was got deferred from the draft 5 times (some deferments were due to being a student, others were from having a "bone spur").

[Source]
https://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/trump-attacks-mccain-i-like-people-who-werent-captured-120317

17.b. An extra note on that last one. General Mattis (retired) made a great joke about Trumps bone spur draft dodging: "I got my spurs on the battlefield, Trump got his from a doctor's note". 

18. Having no political experience whatsoever prior to becoming president. 

19. Asking Comey to consider imprisoning a member of the press.

[Source]
https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/16/trump-allegedly-asked-comey-to-consider-imprisoning-members-of-the-press.html

Now, here's a few about how he's run the economy. These don't necessarily demand impeachment, but they show poor economic policy nonetheless.

20. Pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. 
This is a HUGE failure on behalf of Trump and his administration. When we pulled out of the TPP, China began leading their own talks of a new trade partnership in the pacific... without the US. It was an absolutely stupid move on Trump's part and I don't know how he didn't see that coming, considering he's such a great* businessman and all.

21. Launching a trade war with China (and our EU friends too). 

"More in general the results of this paper point to the fact that the United States tariffs on China are economically hurting both countries. United States losses are largely related to the higher prices for consumers, while China’s losses are related to significant export losses."

...Yikes. Trump's trade war has directly hurt US consumers based on this report from the United Nations.

22. Promising the eliminate the debt in 8 years. National debt is already projected to be 50% higher since he took office.

And here are miscellaneous items: 

23. Trump promised to donate $10,000 to the Twin Towers Fund. No evidence has every been found (nor has Trump tried to provide any) that the money was actually donated.

24. Trump claimed that he had sent his employees to help at Ground Zero immediately after the attack. No evidence has been found that that was the case.

25. In the first ten month's of his presidency, Trump has told nearly 6x the amount of falsehoods that Obama did during his entire presidency.
